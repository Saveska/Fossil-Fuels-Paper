# "Fossil Fuels: Industrial Powerhouses or Environmental Menace?"

Throughout much of human history, our ancestors relied on basic forms of energy: human and animal muscle power, and biomass combustion from wood or crops.

Used to power everything from automobiles to household lighting, fossil fuels meet the world's most significant energy needs. Yet, their extensive use has detrimental effects on climate and biodiversity. Debates now rage over their continued use: is it ethical, safe, and sustainable to rely on them year after year?
